#MFile Mesh Viewer

This repository is created for CZ4004 OpenGL assignment.

The goal of this project is to:
1. parse an MFile, which contains a list of vertices and faces that define a model.
2. construct the half-edge data structure to organise the mesh
3. calculate the normals based on the half-edge data structure
4. provide an intuitive GUI to navigate around the loaded mesh
